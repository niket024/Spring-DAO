Spring disable transactions for a single class method
-----------------------------------------------------
@Transactional(propagation=Propagation.NEVER)
public long notInTransaction(AnythingData anythingData) throws Exception {
   //JDBC code...
}

Will throw an exception if this method is called inside an active transaction. 
Whereas Propagation.NOT_SUPPORTED will "suspend" 
the current transaction and make sure that the method is called non transactional.
